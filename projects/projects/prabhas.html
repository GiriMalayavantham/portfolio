        The film was officially announced in February 2020 under the tentative title Prabhas 21, as it is the actor's 21st film in the lead role and was later changed to working title Project K. Principal photography commenced a year later in July 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was shot sporadically in several legs over the next three years, and wrapped by late-May 2024.

        Kalki 2898 AD was initially scheduled to release on 9 May 2024, but was postponed due to unfinished post-production work. It was released worldwide on 27 June 2024 in standard, IMAX, 3D and 4DX formats. A commercial success, the ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million) Kalki has earned at the worldwide box office has made it the highest-grossing Indian film of 2024 and the 7th highest-grossing Indian film of all time among several other records for a Telugu and Indian film.
        
        Plot
        In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill Uttarā's unborn child. For committing the act Krishna, the 8th reincarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the earth as an immortal and witness humanity's misery as a result of societal and moral deterioration in the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is also taken from his forehead, and his redemption is destined to occur only by protecting the mother of Kalki, Vishnu's 10th and final reincarnation, towards the end of Kali Yuga.[b]
        
        In 2898 AD, 6,000 years after the events of the Kurukshetra War, the desertified city of Kasi stands as the last known city in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian god king. Yaskin rules from the Complex, an inverted-pyramid megastructure that tovers above the city. His authority is enforced by Commander Manas, Counsellor Bani, and Raiders who guard against threats, particularly the prophesied arrival of Kalki.</p>
